# Party DJ ReactJS Client

Party DJ is an application being developed on stream by [GSUGambit](https://twitch.tv/GSUGambitCodes). This WebApp will
allow multiple users to queue up songs and have the app play them in order. We all hate to be the host of a kickback and be
responsible for playing all the music. PartyDJ allows you and friends to all queue up your favorite songs/videos and watch together.
This application will work if all users are locally on wifi or be deployed to the cloud and work for discord calls etc.
